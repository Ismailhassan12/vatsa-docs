# Dammam Delivery [OEDF_1_GND]

This section details all the necesary Standard Operating Procedures for DEL - Delivery in **King Fahd International Airport (OEDF)**


::::caution Do Note

**King Fahd International Airport (OEDF)** does **NOT** have a GMP position. The Ground Movement Planner (GMP) operations are handled by GMC 1. 

During periods of high traffic, the authority to issue clearances may be delegated to GMC 2. 

::::danger Don't get confused!

In this section, GMP (Ground Movement Planner) will be used to refer to Dammam Ground (GMC 1).

# 1.    General Provisions

**Dammam Ground (OEJN_1_GND)** is entrusted with the task of validating routes and providing IFR/VFR clearances to departing aircraft. This involves carefully reviewing the flight plan and cross-verifying the accuracy of the filed route, assigned level, and departure procedure. In situations where any inconsistencies, errors, or invalid information are identified, the controller must rectify the errors and issue a reclearance.

Additionally, the GMP plays a vital role in minimizing potential delays and congestion on the taxiways for outbound flights. During periods characterized by increased departure activities, the GMP implements proactive measures to optimize the flow of traffic. This includes holding aircraft at their stands.

# 2.    Departure Clearance
## 2.1  General

GMP is responsible for issuing IFR/VFR clearances for departing aircraft. Pilots may be expected to report the
following information on first contact:
- Callsign;
- Aircraft type;
- Parking stand;
- Destination;
- Any other special requests

## 2.2 IFR Clearances

An IFR clearance shall contain:

- Destination (Optional);
- Departure procedure;
- Departure runway;
- Initial climb;
- Assigned SSR code

### 2.2.1  Phrasesology

In Dammam, the standard GACA phrasesology is used. For IFR Clearances, the following phrasesolgy must strictly be adhered to.

> **Pilot:** *SVA123, Stand C3, A320, requesting IFR clearance to Jeddah*

> **GMP:** *SVA123, Cleared Jeddah as filed, MIBRA2E Departure, Runway 34L, Initial Climb 4000ft, SQWK XXXX*

<div className="center-align">
  <p>***--------------------------------------------------------------Pilot Readbacks--------------------------------------------------------------***</p>
</div>

> **GMP:** *SVA123, Readback Correct, Information A, Report ready for push and start*

::::tip Keep in mind

GMP shall obtain a full readback of the clearance. If the pilot reports the current information on initial contact, GMP must not repeat it.

### 2.2.2 Departure Procedures
#### 2.2.2.1 RNAV SIDs

Dammam Airport predominantly utilizes **RNAV standard instrument departures (SIDs)** as the preferred departure method for aircraft flying under instrument flight rules (IFR). The selection of the appropriate RNAV departure for departing aircraft is based on the exit point specified in the flight plan and the active runways at the airport.

GMP must always issue RNAV SIDs unless needed otherwise.

|Exit Point|34L|34R|16L|16R|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**METLA**|1E|1F|1H|1G|
|**ROTEL**|1E|1F|2H|2G|
|**LADNA**|1E|1F|1H|1G|
|**RYDAN**|2E|2F|2H|2G|
|**MIBRA**|2E|2F|2H|2G|
|**TAYMA**|2E|2F|2H|2G|
|**EMUSA**|2E|2F|2H|2G|
|**PUSRA**|2E|2F|2H|2G|

‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎  *Table 1.1 - RNAV SIDs of Dammam*
::::info Initial Climb

Regardless of the specific SID chosen, all departures require an initial climb to an altitude of **4000 feet**.

::::

#### 2.2.2.2 Radar Departures
King Fahd International Airport (OEDF) offers two radar departures, namely **DAMMAM1A** and **DAMMAM1B**, specifically designed for aircraft departing from **Runway 34L and 34R**, respectively. These departure procedures involve deviating the aircraft by *15* degrees from the runway heading until further instructions are provided by APP 1.

It is important to note that these radar departures should only be utilized when necessary, and their usage requires coordination with APP 1 and/or APP L.

::::tip
When giving Radar Departures, type **"RDEP"** in the scratch pad so upper controllers don't forget and you too!

::::caution Do note

Runways 16L and 16R do not have radar departures. If needed, Omni-Directional Departures maybe used.

::::
#### 2.2.2.3 Omni-Directional Departures

In exceptional circumstances for 16 operations, omnidirectional departures can be issued in coordination with AIR & APP.


An Omnidirectional departure clearance shall contain the following information:

- Callsign;
- Destination (Optional);
- Expect Radar vectors;
- Departure Runway;
- Initial climb;
- Assigned SSR code

> **Pilot:** *SVA123, Stand C3, A320, requesting IFR clearance to Jeddah*

> **GMP:** *SVA123, Cleared Jeddah as filed, Expect Radar Vectors, Runway 34L, Initial Climb 4000ft, SQWK XXXX*

<div className="center-align">
  <p>***--------------------------------------------------------------Pilot Readbacks--------------------------------------------------------------***</p>
</div>

> **GMP:** *SVA123, Readback Correct, Information A, Report ready for push and start*

The pilot can receive an initial heading as part of the departure clearance, but it should only be given if instructed by AIR & APP.


**Phraseology:**

> **GMP:** *SVA123, Cleared Jeddah as filed, After departure, Maintain Runway Heading, Runway 34L, Initial Climb 4000ft, SQWK XXXX*

***OR***

### 2.3 Rerouting Aircraft
The responsibility of ensuring that all aircraft have the accurate and realistic route lies with the GMP (Ground Movement Planner). The GMP should utilize the RouteChecker tool for this purpose.

If a traffic files an invalid route, they shall be informed by GMP of such as soon as they have connected to the network by private message or on frequency.

#### 2.3.1  Rerouting by voice

GMP may use the following phrasesolgy to reroute traffic.
