### Notes

- It is crucial to maintain a minimum separation of **15-20 nautical miles** horizontally or **1000 feet** vertically between aircraft within the airspace at all times.
- The semi-circular rule must be adhered to in this airspace, which is also **RVSM (Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum)** compliant.
- There are no **Letter of Agreements (LOAs)** between the FIRs. However, it is essential to ensure the transfer of traffic is done with adequate separation.
- The callsign **"Jeddah Control"** must be used during communications.
- Arrival Clearances to **Madinah** must be issued by **ACC W**. The appropriate **STAR** will be selected by the sectorfile. In the case of event traffic, all must be cleared via the **BOVET1G Arrival (17 Config)/ BOVET1H (35 Config)**. Runway and approach will be provided by **APP 1** and **NOT** ACC.
- **ACC W** must ensure the traffic is separated by a minimum of **15nm** prior to entering the **Madinah CTA**. If not achieved, **ACC** must not allow the traffic to enter the CTA and resequence them or coordinate with **APP 1**.
- Traffic entering the **CTA** must not be faster than **280kts**. During peak times or when there is a sequence of at least **4 traffic** with minimum separation, they all must be assigned a speed of **280knots** before handoff to **APP 1**.
- All Traffic must be cleared and passing below **FL240** prior to entering the **Madinah CTA**.
