title: Types of Charts

Charts in aviation are graphical representations or maps that provide pilots with essential information for navigation and flight operations.

They play a crucial role in aviation as they provide essential information for pilots to navigate and maintain situational awareness both on the ground and in the air. On the ground, charts help pilots understand airport procedures, taxi routes, and other pertinent details necessary for safe ground operations. Enroute, charts enable pilots to accurately determine their position, plan their flight path, and adhere to altitude and speed restrictions.

IFR Charts can be classified into different types which are the following:
- 	**[SIDs] Standard Instrument Departures** | Departure route after takeoff to ensure aircraft separation.
