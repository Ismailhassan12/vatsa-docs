title: Runways and wind heading
---
Runways should be exclusively utilized for takeoff and landing in a single direction, primarily determined by the wind's direction.

***Runway Designator***

The runway designator is denoted by a two-digit number that approximates the magnetic North when viewed from the approach direction. For instance, if the centerline azimuth is **343**, the runway designator would be **34**.

***Parallel Runways***

In the case of parallel runways, an additional letter is added to the number to indicate their relative position. The letters **"L" (left), "R" (right), and "C" (center)** define the orientation of each parallel runway from the viewpoint of an observer standing at the threshold.

***Wind direction and speed***

Wind direction is commonly communicated using a three-digit number, rounded to the nearest 10° true, representing the direction from which the wind blows. This information is typically provided in written forecasts, Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS), or weather broadcasts. Following the wind direction, the wind speed is specified in kilometers per hour or knots (NM/hour). For example, a wind blowing from a direction of **273°** true with a speed of 18 knots would be reported as 27018KT.

As shown above, the wind direction is represented by arrows indicating the direction of the wind flow. In the left scenario, the wind is indicated as **030XXKT**, meaning it is coming from 030° with "XX" denoting the wind speed in knots. In the right scenario, the wind is stated as **210XXKT**, indicating a wind direction from **210°**.

It is important to remember that the runway heading is opposite to the wind direction. When standing in the middle of the runway and facing the runway heading, the wind would be blowing from the opposite direction. For example, if the runway heading is **180°**, the wind from **030°** would be a headwind, and the wind from **210°** would be a tailwind when considering takeoff or landing along that runway.
