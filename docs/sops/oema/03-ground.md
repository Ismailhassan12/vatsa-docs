# Madinah Ground [OEMA_X_GND]

This section details all the necessary Standard Operating Procedures for Ground Operations in **Prince Mohammed International Airport (OEMA)**

---

## 1. General Provisions

The Madinah Ground manages aircraft movements on aerodrome areas, excluding runways and their associated taxiways. Departing aircraft receive pushback and taxi instructions to the runway holding point, while arriving aircraft are assigned a stand and given taxi instructions.

---
## 2. Designated Areas of Responsiblity 

**Prince Mohammed International Airport (OEMA)** features **ONE** primary Surface Movement Control (SMC) position (SMC 1). The responsibilities and areas of control for each position are outlined as follows:

iMAGE

### 2.1 Standard Connection Hierarchy 
Controllers must log in the following order to maintain realizm and follow SOPs: 

- SMC 1 [OEMA_GND]
- GMP [OEMA_DEL]

 This hierarchy of connection must always be followed unless ATS staff explictly permit you to do otherwise.

---

## 3.  Procedures
The below procedures are considered as standard and no coordination is required to employ them, except where explicitly required.

::::caution 
Should a situation arise that does not match any of the below cases, coordinate an arrangement with the affected agencies
::::
### 3.1 Push-back Procedures

Aircraft transferred from the Ground Movement Planner (GMP) should be fully prepared for pushback and have reached their Target Off-Block Time (TOBT). If there are no obstructions, they will be instructed to push back immediately. 

However, if an aircraft requesting pushback is not using the correct transponder code, they must be instructed to squawk the correct code before moving.

Aircraft are issued pushback clearances by the SMC controlling the respective apron that the aircraft is parking at.

The pushback direction is based primarily on aircraft location, runway configuration and the apron's flow direction.


#### 3.1.1  Apron Flow Direction

The apron's flow direction can be determined by examining the taxiway diagrams outlined in *Section 3.2.6* of this aerodrome's GND SOP.

By looking at the entry and exit taxiways of the apron, it is very obvious what the direction that all traffic should face.

|       **Apron(s)**       |     _North Config_     | _South Config_ |
|:------------------------:|:-----------------------:|:---------------:|
|        **East Apron**       |        Southbound       |    Northbound   |
|        **West Apron**       |        South-West bound       |    South-West bound    |
|        **Remote Apron**       |        South-West bound        |    South-West bound    |

  <p>*Table 3.1.1 - Madinah Apron Flow Direction*</p>
</div>

#### 3.1.2  Push-Back Types
##### 3.1.2.1 Standard Push-back
This is the default type of push-back which will normally have the aircraft stop abeam the adjacent stand.

***Phrasesolgy:*** 

> **Pilot:** SVA123, Stand 108, request pushback.

> **GMP:** SVA123, Push & Start Approved, Face North on L.

::::tip Be helpful!

If you wish to be helpful towards the pilots, you may give them the local QNH. This is not mandatory as the pilot acknowledged the latest ATIS which contains the QNH!

::::
##### 3.1.2.2 Short Push-back
A short pushback instruction shall require the aircraft to complete the pushback abeam the current stand such that the adjacent stand will not be blocked.

***Phrasesolgy:*** 

> **Pilot:** SVA123, Stand 108, requesting pushback.

> **GMP:** SVA123, Short Pushback Approved, Face North on L.

##### 3.1.2.3 Long Push-back
A long pushback instruction shall require aircraft to complete the pushback operation more then two stands away from where the pushback was commenced. This manoeuvre may be used when an aircraft is vacating a stand to be used by another aircraft that is taxing in.

***Phrasesolgy:*** 

> **Pilot:** SVA123, Stand 108, request pushback.

> **GMP:** SVA123, Long Pushback Approved, Face North on L.

::::info Be Specific!

If you desire to provide precise instructions regarding the end point of the pushback, you can use the following phraseology to instruct the aircraft to halt at a specific position:

> **GMP:** SVA123, Long Pushback Approved, Face North on L, Finish Abeam stand XX.

*or if you wish the aircraft keeps a taxiway clear*

> **GMP:** SVA123, Long Pushback Approved, Face North on L, Stay Clear of Taxiway XX.

::::

##### 3.1.2.4 Conditional Push-back

In certain situations, conditional pushback instructions may be given when there is an aircraft taxiing behind another aircraft that is waiting for pushback. This ensures safe coordination and efficient movement on the taxiway. This type of pushback is always prefered to be used when applicable as it saves radio time and eases the controller's job.

An example of such an instruction is as follows:

> **Pilot:** SVA123, Stand 108, request pushback.

> **GMP:** SVA123, Behind the Qatari B777 passing from your right to left, push & start approved, Face North on L. Behind.

::::info Airline

When giving the clearance, the "airline" should be mentioned and not "callsign". 

For example:

> **GMP:** SVA123, Behind the **Britsh Airways** (~~Speedbird~~) B777 passing from your right to left, push & start approved, face east on WA. Behind.

---

In addition, if both aircraft involved in the conditional pushback instruction belong to the same airline, it is common to specify the relationship by saying "Behind the Company B777".
::::

::::caution Do note.

The traffic is only mandated to say "Behind" **once**. The controller is mandated to say it **twice** to ensure the instruction is clear.
::::

##### 3.1.2.5 Simultaneous pushback operations
Simultaneous pushbacks from neighboring stands may be allowed if aircraft are directed using the pushback types described in section 3.1. The aim is to ensure that once both aircraft have completed their pushback procedures, they will be positioned on the taxiway with one stand between them.

#### 3.2.2 Stand Allocation Procedure
Stands are assigned by the GRPlugin in the Euroscope, but controllers should preferably have a basic idea of stand assignments.

#### 3.2.5  Arrival Taxi Procedures
##### 3.2.5.1 General Arrival Taxi Procedures
SMC 1 should promptly assign a stand to an aircraft as soon as it appears on the arrival list using the stand assigner in the sectorfile . This enables the Tower controller to clear the aircraft to the appropriate vacating point, allowing them to follow the Arrival Taxi Procedures outlined below. It also allows the Tower controller to assign the correct Arrival Taxi Route (ATR) to the aircraft once it has vacated the runway.

Upon vacating the runway, the Tower controller will instruct the aircraft to follow the designated ATR and provide the correct ground frequency for communication. Subsequently, the Ground controller is responsible for providing a taxi route that aligns with the prescribed taxiroutes mentioned below.
