# Madinah Delivery [OEMA_GND]

This section details all the necessary Standard Operating Procedures for Delivery Operations in **Prince Mohammed International Airport (OEMA)**

::::caution Do Note

**Prince Mohammed International Airport (OEMA)** does **NOT** have a GMP position. The Ground Movement Planner (GMP) operations are handled by SMC.

During periods of high traffic, the authority to issue clearances may be delegated to SMC.

::::danger Don't get confused!

In this section, GMP (Ground Movement Planner) will be used to refer to Madinah Ground (SMC).

::::

# 1. General Provisions

**Madinah Clearance (OEMA_GND)** is entrusted with the task of validating routes and providing IFR/VFR clearances to departing aircraft. This involves carefully reviewing the flight plan and cross-verifying the accuracy of the filed route, assigned level, and departure procedure. In situations where any inconsistencies, errors, or invalid information are identified, the controller must rectify the errors and issue a reclearance.

Additionally, the GMP plays a vital role in minimizing potential delays and congestion on the taxiways for outbound flights. During periods characterized by increased departure activities, the GMP implements proactive measures to optimize the flow of traffic. This includes holding aircraft at their stands.

---

# 2. Departure Clearance

## 2.1 General

GMP is responsible for issuing IFR/VFR clearances for departing aircraft. Pilots may be expected to report the
following information on first contact:

-   Callsign;
-   Aircraft type;
-   Parking stand;
-   Destination;
-   Any other special requests

---

::::danger Beware!

Traffic must be cleared for runway 36/18 only upon the pilot's request and approval from AIR.

::::

## 2.2 IFR Clearances

An IFR clearance shall contain:

-   Destination (Optional);
-   Departure procedure;
-   Departure runway;
-   Initial climb;
-   Assigned SSR code

### 2.2.1 Phrasesology

In Madinah, the standard GACA phrasesology is used. For IFR Clearances, the following phrasesolgy must strictly be adhered to.

> **Pilot:** _SVA123, Stand 104, A320, requesting IFR clearance to Dammam_

> **GMP:** _SVA123, Cleared Dammam as filed, XXXXX Departure, Runway 17, Initial Climb 8000ft, SQWK XXXX_

<div className="center-align">
  <p>***--------------------------------------------------------------Pilot Readbacks--------------------------------------------------------------***</p>
</div>

> **GMP:** _SVA123, Readback Correct, Information A, Report ready for push and start_

::::tip Keep in mind

GMP shall obtain a full readback of the clearance. If the pilot reports the current information on initial contact, GMP must not repeat it.

### 2.2.2 Departure Procedures

#### 2.2.2.1 RNAV SIDs

Madinah Airport predominantly utilizes **RNAV standard instrument departures (SIDs)** as the preferred departure method for aircraft flying under instrument flight rules (IFR). The selection of the appropriate RNAV departure for departing aircraft is based on the exit point specified in the flight plan and the active runways at the airport.

GMP must always issue RNAV SIDs unless needed otherwise.

| **Exit Points** | **ALTEP** | **MIXUG** | **MEDRO** | **SISUD** | **UKTOM** | **PEGUR** |
|:---------------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
|      **35**     |     1K    |     1K    |     1K    |     1K    |     1K    |     1K    |
|      **17**     |     1J    |     1J    |     1J    |     1J    |     1J    |     1J    |
|      **36**     |     1L    |     1L    |     1L    |     1L    |     1L    |     1L    |
|      **18**     |     1C    |     1C    |     1C    |     1C    |     1C    |     1C    |

<div className="center-align">
  <p>*Table 1.1 - RNAV SIDs*</p>
</div>

::::info Initial Climb

In Madinah, regardless of the specific SID chosen, all departures should be assigned an initial climb of **8000 feet**.

::::

#### 2.2.2.2 Radar Departures

**Prince Mohammed International Airport (OEMA)** offers **two** radar departures as shown below.

It is important to note that these radar departures should only be utilized when necessary, and their usage requires coordination with APP.

<div className="center-align">
 <p>
|   Runway        | Radar Departure|
| :-------------: | :-------: |
|     **35/36**     |    MADINAH1T     | 
|     **17/18**     |    MADINAH1Z     | 
</p>
</div>
<div className="center-align">
  <p>*Table 1.2 - Radar Departures*</p>
</div>
::::info Coordination For Radar Departures


SVA123 is requesting MADINAH1T due to outdated AIRAC. GMP must call APP via VCCS to coordinate

> **GMP:** _Calls APP via VCCS_

> **APP:** _Accepts call from GMP_

> **GMP -> APP:** _APP, SVA123 is an A320 requesting JEDDAH1B._

> **APP -> GMP:** _GMP, Copied._



::::tip
When giving Radar Departures, type **"RDEP"** in the scratch pad so upper controllers don't forget and you too!

### 2.2.3 Rerouting Traffic

The responsibility of ensuring that all aircraft have the accurate and realistic route lies with the GMP. The GMP should utilize the RouteChecker tool for this purpose.

If a traffic files an invalid route, they shall be informed by GMP of such as soon as they have connected to the network by private message or on frequency.

#### 2.2.3.1 Rerouting by voice

GMP may use the following phrasesolgy to reroute traffic.

> **GMP:** SVA123, Cleared Riyadh, EGREP T532 KAVUR, Flight plan route, EGREP2W, Runway 34C, Initial Climb 6000ft, SQWK XXXX

Altough this is allowed, it consumes time on frequency which maybe needed for other traffic on the frequency. Therefore, Rerouting by Private Message is preferred.

#### 2.2.3.2 Rerouting by private message

This is the preferred way of rerouting traffic. Refer to the Alias.

---

### 2.2.4 Crusing Flight Level (CFL)

GMP must ensure all traffic are cleared on the appropriate CFL. Refer to the Saudi S1 Training vMATS.

#### 2.2.4.1 Semi-Circular Rule

GMP must ensure the semi-circular rule is followed. For more information regarding the Semi-Circular Rule, refer to the Saudi S1 Training vMATS.

### 2.2.5 Delay Mitigation

Refer to [Supplementary Guides - Flow Management Procedures](/docs/sup/Special%20Procedures/Flow%20Management%20Procedures/flow-management-procedures).

## 2.3 VFR Clearances

GMP is responsible for issuing VFR Clearances as well. Prior to issuing a VFR Clearance to any traffic, GMP **must** coordinate with AIR.

### 2.3.1 VFR Circuits

|     **Runway Configuration**      | **Direction** |   **Altitude(s)**            |
| :--: | :------------: | :-----------: |
| 35/36|   Right Hand   |     1500ft AGL    |

#### 2.3.1.2 Phrasesolgy

> **GMP:** _HAZAZ, Cleared VFR Circuits, Runway 35, Make a right hand circuit, climb to 1500ft, SQWK XXXX._

<div className="center-align">
  <p>***--------------------------------------------------------------Pilot Readbacks--------------------------------------------------------------***</p>
</div>

> **GMP:** _HAZAZ, Readback Correct, Information A, Report Ready for Startup_ **_(Pushback if on a terminal/Jet Aircraft)_**

---

### 2.3.2 VFR Crosscountry

Any VFR aircraft leaving the control zone at Madinah is considered to be engaging in cross-country VFR flight.

Prior to granting clearance for cross-country VFR traffic, coordination with the AIR and APP is required.

There are no specific restrictions, designated VFR routes, or prescribed exit points for VFR departures leaving the control zone at Jeddah.

::::info Do note

VFR Crosscountry traffic are considered as departures and shall depart from the active departure runway unless needed otherwise by AIR.
